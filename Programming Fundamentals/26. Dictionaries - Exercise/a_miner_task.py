"""
You will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line until you receive the "stop" command.
Every odd line on the console represents a resource (e.g., Gold, Silver, Copper, and so on) and every even - quantity.
Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line.
Print the resources and their quantities in the following format:
"{resource} -> {quantity}"
The quantities will be in the range [1 … 2 000 000 000].
