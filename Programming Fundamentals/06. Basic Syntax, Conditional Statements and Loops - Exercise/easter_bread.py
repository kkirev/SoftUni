"""
Since it is Easter, you have decided to make some loaves of Easter bread and exchange them for eggs.
Create a program that calculates how many loaves you can make (according to the recipe) with the budget you have.
Here is the recipe for one loaf:
                                Eggs	1 pack
                                Flour	1 kg
                                Milk	0.250 l
First, you will receive your budget. Then, you will receive the price for 1 kg flour. The price for 1 pack of eggs
is 75% of the price for 1 kg flour. The price for 1L milk is 25% more than the price for 1 kg flour. Keep in mind that
 you use only 250ml milk for bread.
Start cooking the loaves and keep making them until you have enough budget. Keep in mind that:
•	For every loaf of bread that you make, you will receive 3 colored eggs.
•	For every 3rd bread you make, you will lose some of your colored eggs after receiving the usual 3 colored eggs for
your bread. The count of eggs you will lose is calculated when you subtract 2 from your current count of
loaves - ({current_bread_count} - 2)
In the end, print the loaves of bread you made, the eggs you have collected, and the money you have left, formatted to
the 2nd decimal place, in the following format:
"You made {number_of_loaves} loaves of Easter bread! Now you have {colored_eggs} eggs and {money_left}BGN left."
Input / Constraints
•	On the 1st line, you will receive the budget - a real number in the range [0.0…100000.0]
•	On the 2nd line, you will receive the price for 1 kg flour - a real number in the range [0.0…100000.0]
•	The input will always be in the correct format
•	You will always have a remaining budget
•	There will not be a case in which the eggs become a negative count
Output
•	In the end, print the number of loaves of Easter bread you have made, the colored eggs you have gathered, and the
money formatted to the 2nd decimal place in the format described above.
